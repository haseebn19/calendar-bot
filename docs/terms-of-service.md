# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** December 29, 2025

By using or adding Calendar Bot (the "Bot") to a Discord server, you agree to these Terms.

## 1. The Service

Calendar Bot helps users manage personal calendar events and settings such as timezone and a public or private display mode. The Bot includes commands to delete events and delete all stored bot data.

## 2. No Warranty

The Bot is provided "as is" and "as available". We do not guarantee uptime, reliability, availability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

## 3. No Support

We do not provide user support, custom work, or service level commitments.

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:
- Use the Bot in ways that violate Discord's rules or applicable law
- Attempt to disrupt, overload, reverse engineer, scrape, or bypass access controls or rate limits
- Use the Bot to store highly sensitive personal information (for example passwords, financial numbers, government IDs)

## 5. Your Content and Visibility

You are responsible for what you enter into the Bot (for example event titles and event times).

- If you choose **public mode**, outputs may be visible to others in the channel where you used a command.
- If you choose **private mode**, the Bot uses Discord's ephemeral responses, which are intended to be visible only to you.

## 6. Changes and Shutdown

We may update, modify, suspend, or discontinue the Bot at any time, with or without notice.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, arising from your use of the Bot.

## 8. Privacy

See our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy) for details on data collection and deletion.
