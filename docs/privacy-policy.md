# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** December 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains what Calendar Bot (the "Bot") collects and how it is used.

## 1. What Data the Bot Collects

The Bot collects the minimum information needed to provide its features. This can include:
- Discord user ID (to associate events and settings with you)
- Optional context identifiers like server (guild) ID and channel ID (to respond correctly)
- Settings you choose (timezone and privacy mode)
- Event data you submit via commands (for example event title and date/time)

The Bot is not intended to read or store your normal chat messages. It only processes data needed to respond to commands.

## 2. How the Bot Uses Data

The Bot uses this data to:
- Create, list, and remove your calendar events
- Apply timezone conversion and formatting
- Respect your privacy mode choice (public or private output behavior)
- Operate and maintain the service (including basic debugging and abuse prevention)

## 3. Sharing

We do not sell your data.

We do not share your data with third parties except:
- Hosting providers used to run the Bot (only as necessary to operate it)
- Legal or safety reasons if required by law

Discord also processes data under Discord's own policies when you use Discord.

## 4. Retention

We keep data only as long as needed for the Bot to function.

## 5. Deletion (Self Service)

You can delete your data at any time using the Bot's built-in commands:
- `/calendar wipe` — deletes all your events
- `/settings wipe` — deletes all your data (events and account/settings)

After deletion, some limited information may remain temporarily in operational logs or backups (if any) for a short period.

## 6. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect stored data, but no system can guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy. Updates will be posted here with a new effective date.

## 8. Contact (Privacy/Legal Only)

**Email:** calendarbot.privacy@outlook.com

We do not provide user support. For deletion, use the wipe commands above.
